In the previous meeting, we discussed our plans to have every user component working with react js and express. 
Our main goals for this sprint were connecting all three GUIs into 1 Site and  styling all of the GUIs.
We also expressed our desire to begin working on implementing the APIâ€™s in the next sprint.  
We also took time to redetermine the time for each task.
